            <section>

            <p>Science:</p>

<p>It is a method of learning about physical universe. Scientists use different equipment to do an experiment. First of all they need a laboratory (a lab), where they can conduct (provádět) the experiment. Then tehy need a microscope to look at very small objects. The also need a beaker to measure chemicals and a test tube to mix chemicals. Everyone needs a lab coat to protect clothes durong the experiment and, of course, a computer to store and calculate results.</p>

<p>Fields of science: chemistry, physics, biology, …</p>

<p>Technology:</p>

<p>It is the development and application of tools, machines, materials and processes that help to solve human problems in different areas, like medicine, space, computers and so on.</p>

<p>We have many famous scientists that made a huge input into development of science and technology.:</p>

<p>Isaac Newton – who first developer the idea of gravity and the laws of motion</p>

<p>Nicholaus Copernicus – was the first person who had a theory that the Earth revolved around the sun</p>

<p>Galileo Galilei – he proved with a telescope that the Earth revolved around the sun</p>

<p>Marie Curie – developer the theory of radioactivity and she discovered new elements, polonium and radium</p>

<p>Albert Enstein – developer the theory of rlativity, which described the nature of gravity in relation to space and time</p>

<p>Significant inventions:</p>

<p>Wheel – transport people, quickly, cheap and it is better for environment</p>

<p>Penicillion – it i sone of the greatest inventions because it kills bacteria and saves lives</p>

<p>X-ray – is important in medicine as it helps doctors to look inside the human body</p>

<p>Telephone – allows people to communicate over long distances</p>

<p>Computer – allows people to calculate, store information, communicate with others across the world</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have also some inventions that are dangerous, for example nuclear bomb or guns as they kill people.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have to agree though that science and technology changed our lives. In the past it was hard to examine human body, find out the reasons of disease and sure it, so a lot of people died. Nowadays there is a huge range of drugs and vaccinations to terat and protect people from different diseases. Doctors use new apparatuses like mammography, EKG, laser, and so on. Doctors can even transplant organs.</p>

<p>We can also see a difference in transportation. There are many different means of transport and people can even travel from one continent to another in a couple of hours. Cars are safer and use a new system of airbags and automatic controls. Trains are faster and also safer. Trucks (nákladní auta), cranes (jeřáby) and bulldozers are used in agriculture and make people’s work much easier. But in the other hand, these means of transport produce a lot of exhaust fumes (výfukových výparů), which pollute air a lot.</p>

<p>Exist many great inventions in communication. Many people use mobile phones, you can take photos with is, write short messages, connect to the internet, and listen to music. The most popular way of communication today is the internet. It is an unlimited source of information. You can chat with people, send e-mails and buy things. But the internet can be misused (zneužíván) by hackers.</p>

<p>There has been a huge development in space research as well. People fly to the moon and the mars. They look for new civilization, materials and natural resources. People build spaceships, space stations and satellites with different functions.</p>

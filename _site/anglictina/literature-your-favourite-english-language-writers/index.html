These two houses hate each other and Romeo Montague meets Juliet at the ball. He fells in love with her although he knows that she is Capulet. They love each other very much and ask Friar Laurence to marry them. Their love and marriage are secret and by an unfortunate coincidence Romeo kills Tybalt who is Juliet’s cousin. Prince of Verona sends Romeo to the exile outside Verona and young Juliet is forced to get married to a young nobleman called Paris. She asks Friar Laurence to help again and he gives her magic drops after which she fells asleep for several hours and looks as if she was dead. Romeo learns about Juliet’s death in Mantua and hurries to the Capulet´s Monument in a churchyard. He does no know about the trick and kills himself. Soon after the Juliet wakes up and when she sees Romeo dead, she kills herself to. Both Montague and Capulet Houses reconciliate only after the death of their beloved children.</li>

Soon after the revolution, two pigs – Napoleon and Snowball set themselves in the role of leaders. To imprint the basic rules into animals´ minds, Seven Commandments (a sort of constitution) are written on the wall. After a certain period of time a coup d´état took place, establishing Napoleon as a new leader. With a guard of fierce-looking dogs, he keeps other animals in fear and obedience. Step by step the pigs are acting more like human beings including money trade, wearing clothes etc. The happening culminates, when the pigs started to walk on their hind legs, using a whip to keep other animals at work</li>

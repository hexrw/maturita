            <p><strong>THE MEDIA</strong></p>

<p>The media communicate information to people. It includes magazines, television, newspaper, or radio. We have many options, where find information about the world or live.</p>

<p>Magazines and newspapers are types of media for people, who like to read. We can learn news about political situations and cultural events, details about new discoveries or results of sports matches. In the newspaper, we can read articles based on truth or research, but the magazine can be something like a boulevard. These articles are more attractive for reading. But you can’t rely on the information. We can buy magazines and newspapers at the newsagent. The newspapers are issued every day and magazines are issued once a week, once a month, or irregularly.</p>

<p>Those who don’t like reading can take information from the radio. We can find out the weather forecast, programs of cinemas or theatres or discussions with famous characters. I think every one of us has a car and so we listen to the radio, but we just don’t realize it. For example, we find, what new accidents are. Even this is important for us, and it is some information. So, the radio is almost everywhere, therefore, you can listen at home, in shops, and in a restaurant and so on.</p>

<p>A more comfortable form of media is television. Many people prefer watching TV to listening to the radio. It is easier to imagine what they are talking about when you can see it. You can lie down on a sofa, and you don’t have to think about anything. We get the same information as on the radio. But the are also some serials, talk shows, and competitions. We can learn some new things. Advertising is the main source of income for TV.</p>

<p>A special form of media is the internet. The internet has been developed quite recently – less than 20 years ago. It is a great source of information about everything. You can find people, products and so on. You can contact your friends all over the world thanks to e-mail or Facebook. Internet is a good helper if you need to find some information about a new technology or if you need something for school. If you want to buy something you search for it on the internet – the same product by different manufactures. You can compare prices. Whether the products in the shops are cheaper or more expensive. It is also easy to plan your holiday online. You can find the destination, you can look for accommodation and you can learn about the country – like language, currency and so on.</p>

<p><strong>INFLUENCE ON SOCIETY</strong></p>

<p>The media can have a positive or negative impact on society. negative effects can lead people to poverty, violence, poor mental illness, and the like. I think the negative influences of the media are still increasing. we most often see them in children. kids trust every message they read on the internet, or they trust people who make videos on YouTube. These people are not always the right examples. For example, we are influenced by false news or political propaganda. However, the media can also have a positive impact. People help each other in situations of natural disasters or in encouraging children and the like. Many people use the media thanks quizzes or games to learn something new. Every influence of the media is visible to us humans, whether it is positive or negative. He thinks that people should limit the use of the internet and rather watch the news on television. I think it’s a better source of the right information. I know a lot of people or rather mothers who search the internet for every illness that their child has and eventually find out from the doctor that it is nothing serious. so why stress yourself unnecessarily.</p>

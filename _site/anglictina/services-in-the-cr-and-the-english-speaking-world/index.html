                <h1>Services in the CR and the English-speaking World</h1>
            

            <section>

            <p>Public services: are provided (poskytovány) by the government</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public transport, education, garbage removal, radio and television services</li>
  <li>Police, fire services, hospital (health services)</li>
</ul>

<p>Private services: more expensive and have better quality</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shops. Internet, restaurants, pubs, banks, hairdresser’s, …</li>
</ul>

<p>When we want to have our hair cut, we go to the hairdresser´s. She can wash our hair, cut it, dye and dry it or do a special</p>

<p>styling. We can either visit her in her salon or we can find a hairdresser who comes to our home. Men go to the barber´s</p>

<p>where they can have their face shaved and hair cut.</p>

<p>Women like going to beauty parlor and nail studios for manicure and pedicure.</p>

<p>When you need glasses or have your eyes checked, you can go to the optician´s. There is a variety of glasses of different shapes and colours, contact lenses or sunglasses, or goggles for cycling and skiing.</p>

<p>If you need a professional photo, you may go to the photographer´s. If you have your own digital photo, you can bring it on</p>

<p>a CD to the shop or you can send it to the shop on the internet. Then you get your photos by post.</p>

<p>If your car is broken, it can be repaired in a car repair shop.</p>

<p>When clocks or watches are broke down they can be repaired at the watchmaker´s.</p>

<p>Estate agent´s offer houses, flats to people who want to lease or buy them.</p>

<p>When we want to go on holiday we can buy one at the travel agent´s.</p>

<p>Post service delivers us letters, packages or money. Nowadays, the post service is not as important as it used to be because</p>

<p>people use email.</p>

<p>If we don´t like cleaning we can pay an agency for cleaning our flat (they hoover our carpets, dust our furniture, clean the</p>

<p>windows or do the laundry and do the ironing). This is not very usual in our country</p>

<p><em>Health centre</em> – hospitals – doctors, nurses, pharmacist</p>

<p><em>Library</em> – this building has a large variety of books to borrow. It has an excellent range of audio-visual materials and specialist magazines.</p>

<p><em>Post office</em> – this is place, where you go, when you want to send some postcard or letter. You can pay bills or send money.</p>

<p><em>Restaurant</em> – you need to make a reservation for a table her at least a day in advance (alespoň den předem).</p>

<p><em>Food delivery services:</em></p>

<p>In Czechia and almost the rest of the world there is now a known food delivery service. Retail food delivery is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_service">courier service</a> in which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant">restaurant</a>, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entr%C3%A9e">entrees</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_dish">sides</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink">drinks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert">desserts</a>, or grocery items and are typically delivered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box">boxes</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag">bags</a>. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City">cities</a> where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle">bikes</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_scooter">motorized scooters</a>. Recently, we have also seen the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_vehicles">autonomous vehicles </a>by companies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Technologies">Starship Technologies</a>, currently available in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> to complete deliveries</p>

<p><em>Taxi services: + public transports and station</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Hackney carriages, private hire vehicles, taxi buses, limousines, …</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences between services in CR and in Britain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Britain, lots of people take the washing to the laundry (prádelna). In The Czech Republic, people do it at home because everybody ha a washing machine, but people use dry-cleaner’s</li>
</ul>

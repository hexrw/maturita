            <p><strong>Christmas</strong> – 24th December, 25th – Christmas Day, 26th – Boxing Day – Christmas is the most important holiday for Christians because it is a day when Jesus Christ was born, so Christmas is the celebration of the birth. But it is the most favourite holiday too. The main Christmas day here is 24th December – Christmas Eve. It is called Generous (štědrý) day. Before this day, we bake some sweets. In every family we buy presents, we decorate the house with advent wreaths, candles, Christmas tree, stars, and other ornaments. We don’t eat anything before dinner because we have a tradition of seeing a golden pig. Our dinner is carp with potato salad, and we get our presents on Christmas Eve in the evening after Christmas dinner. We have a midnight mass, but in my village, we go to the church around five o’clock. Our favourite tradition is cutting apples. I watch fairy tale stories on Tv with my family, relaxing and we go to the forest, and we give to eat for “wild” animals. On the following two days, people visit their family and test other kinds of sweets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In GB people have no traditional celebration on this day, it is not a holiday. A lot of people spend this day shopping. They decorate the Christmas tree, hang holly and ivy in the room, and mistletoe is hung over the door. If you catch a girl under it, you are allowed to kiss her. Before children go to bed, they hung up Christmas stockings at the end of their beds and believe that Father Christmas fills up the stockings with presents. Children open presents in the morning.</li>
  <li>In the USA Christmas is not a national holiday. Almost all shops are closed, and people have a rest on this day. Americans and British origin follow the same traditions as their ancestors. The person who brings children presents is called Santa Claus. Children hang their stockings on a mantelpiece of the fireplace, and they leave milk, and cookies for Santa to eat.</li>

<p><strong>Easter</strong> - is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first spring full moon. Christians remember the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Easter eggs are given as presents. They symbolize a new life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the Czech Republic boys have stock whips and they go from house to house and hit girls stock whips. When whipping they must recite a traditional poem. There are many variations of this tradition. Girls give the boys a painted egg or chocolate and tie a bow on whip or money. People have decorated houses. We have spring decorations and ceramic sheep at home. I colour the eggs with the mother and sisters. The days before Easter Sunday: Ugly Wednesday (škaredá středa), Green Thursday (zelený čtvrtek), Good Friday (Velký pátek), White Saturday (bílá sobota)</li>
  <li>In the USA Easter is not a national holiday. Most Americans spend Easter Sunday with their family.</li>

The holiday I on 14th February and people give presents to the people they love. People send Valentine’s cards, usually anonymously, and exchange gifts. Cards usually have a romantic message inside. It is an English Holiday, and so some people don’t like this holiday.</p>

Children like dressing in funny or ghostly costumes. They go from house to house and knock on their door or ring the bell. When people answer the door they say, “Trick or treat” which means “give us a treat or we will play a trick on you”. The people treat the children with sweets, fruit, or money. People often give parties on Halloween. They like decorating their houses and carving the pumpkin bogeys.</li>

Sport and games are very important for active relaxation and are also important for our physical and mental health. 

I don't know the main difference between sport and game, but I would say that sport is something that a person or group moves with. The game is more for fun and entertainment. Sport is some physical activity. Someone has as the main difference between sport and game that the game is more collective, and the sport is more individual. This means that some take football or basketball as a game.

We can practice some sports and games indoors and some of them outdoors. In the first group, there are, for example, ice-hockey, basketball, handball, skating, … and in the second group, there are, for example, baseball, golf, winter sports like skiing, riding and so on. Some sport such as diving, or racing can be quite dangerous and very expensive. 

There are also very important world sports events. The most famous is The Olympic Games (the Olympics), which are held every four years and have got its summer and winter part, which change once every two years. Other important events are The World and The European Championships and Cups in almost every type of sports (in football, athletics, …), The Grand Slam Tennis Tournaments, The Formula One Championship, etc.

**Famous people on The Olympic Games**: Usain Bolt (Jamaica - athletics), Michael Phelps (USA - swimming), Ole Bjorndalen (Norway – biathlon), Věra Čáslavska (Czech Republic – gymnastic), Emil Zátopek (athletics), …

Typical sports for:

**GREAT BRITAIN**

Many sports have their origins in Britain that is why Britain is sometimes called the cradle of sports. Cricket, two types of rugby, the modern game of hockey, tennis or boxing was invented in Britain. Golf, also called the sport of rich people, has it been origins in Scotland. amongst the minor sports, taekwondo and together with judo is an Olympic sport. 

Cricket – often called a national sport, it has never spread in foreign countries, it is intensively played only in the UK, Australia, and some other Commonwealth countries, it is played on a cricket field of the approximate size of two pitches, two teams of 11 members, they use cricket-bat and a small leather-ball. It is interesting that one match might last even three days.

Football – there are a great number of clubs. Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea belongs among the most famous. The Football League is the English football championship, and it is the oldest competition in world football. 

**AMERICA (THE USA, CANADA)**

Sports play an important part in the lives of Americans. Some sports are popular all over America, while other sports, such as Lacrosse or ice-hockey, are popular in certain regions. However, the big three sports still are American football, baseball, and basketball. These games are turned into big shows in which the sports stars make a lot of money. each of them has its own national competition. football teams across the country compete for the grand prize in the Superbowl. baseball teams strive to win in the World Series. in basketball, the highest achievement is to win the NBA Championship. in ice-hockey there is the Stanley Cup for the winner of the NHL.

American football – two teams, wearing helmets and pads, throw and run with an oddly-shaped ball (similar to a rugby ball). They block with their bodies and try to help other players on their team gain more ground. If they cross a goal line at the end of the field, they score a touchdown, which is six points

Baseball – is similar to the |English game of cricket. Nine players on each team take turns, trying to hit a leather ball with a wooden bat. After the ball is hit, the players run, stepping on bases, before he returns to where he was when he hit the ball, and scores a run (point) for his team. If the other team touches him with the ball, he is “out” and must leave the field. 

**AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND**

Because of the climate, water sports are popular in Australia – sailing and surfing in coastal areas and water-skiing in rivers and lakes. Summer is the time for tennis, cricket, and golf. In winter, cricket grounds make way for the sport unique to Australia – Aussie Rules Football. It began in Melbourne and is now perhaps the biggest national sport. 

Ball-oriented sports are very popular in New Zealand. In winter, Kiwis (New Zealanders) enjoy rugby and indoor netball. In summer, cricket and touch rugby are popular, and netball becomes commonplace too. Netball, traditionally a women’s game, is now popular with both sexes. It is similar to basketball, but the rules are stricter, and not as much movement is allowed. New Zealand is the best in the world at the moment. 

**THE CZECH REPUBLIC**

I think, our country (Czech Republic) has many popular sports, for example, football, tennis, ice-hockey, volleyball, floorball and so on. Ice- hockey is very popular because we have a lot of teams. I think it is around 25 teams, but I am not sure.  In the winter Olympic Games, we have a very good team in biathlon or in skiing. Popular summer sports in our country include athletics, swimming, and so on.

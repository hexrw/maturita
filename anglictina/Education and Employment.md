Education

- Education changes every year or maybe even faster
- People have many different opinions on education – I personally think about school system has many mistakes. Some teachers just say something to us and then count with that we will always remember, and they think the subject they teach is the important.

I don’t like we have to study for many years to be able to do your dream job. I understand we have to know how to do it, in some profession we need know ledge, but some information is really not necessary and useless for us. I think it is life who teaches us almost everything.

- I like schools where teacher have personally approach to students (private school) and make them feel like they are one big family. I think it helps students to feel comfortable and then they can focus well, because they are not anxious or stressed.

title: Cross-cultural Differences (Race, Gender, Religion, ...)

There are 3 races in the world. Europoid, non-humid and Mongoloid race. we would normally say black, white and yellow race. today, great differences are made between races. some people swear at each other on different races. we can call it racism. some people do not take others as they are. they make fun of them and laugh at them. I don't think we should make a difference between them. all people are still like others.

another problem is sexism. A lot of people look at whether you are a woman or a man. but why make a difference? both women and men go to work. both also take care of work at home. I don't think it's good to divide women and men into groups. in China, for example, a family can only have a boy as a child. but then there are few women in the world. I don't think that's the right approach for them. there are also differences in sports. It is said men are better at it, but again this may not be true. in Australia, for example, we have a sport that is mostly played by women, but now men also play it because they did not want to make a difference between the sexes. we could include feminism here.

There are also big problems among people who practice a religion. today we have a lot of species. Islam, Christianity, which is further divided, then we have Buddhism, Hinduism and so on. there are really many of them in the world. I think mainly unbelievers are making trouble with this. my family is very religious and I can see some people laughing at us going to church. but it can all be the same. it is only our business and free choice. some chose to believe and some vice versa, so why make a difference and a problem.

- every culture is different in many ways
- people from different culture have different behaviour, reactions, ability of Teamwork, socializing, communication, ….
- Body language is very important for cross-culture people. It helps to understand the communication and it might be help so much to understand even without talking. Body language says a lot about us and we can read others by that

Cross-culture people have different gesticulation – while eating, situation rating (I don’t know)

- Cross-culture people greet differently. Every greeting in special in every country – In Czech we say hi and shake hands while official meetings. German’s hug and usually do some handshake, Brazilian hug and give kisses on cheeks, Japanese wave their hands while saying hello and so on, … 
- Some cultures are more free and friendly, kind

Other cultures don’t say hi on streets

- Expressing feelings – American x Czech (I love you)
- Food is also one of the cross-cultural differences – American, English and Czech breakfast = everything different
- Kids working in different countries

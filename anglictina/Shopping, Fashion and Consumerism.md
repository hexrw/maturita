Shopping:

- It is activity, which is very important for our lives. We spend a lot of money for new things and necessary (potřebné) things like food and clothes.

Types of shops:

*Shopping centre* – there are lots of shops in one building. Most of them are clothes shops and boutiques, some shops with jewellery, cosmetics, but we can find stalls woth fast food and cafés. Sometimes there is a children’s court and sometimes also a cinema. In Czech Budweis we can find th shopping centre, for example Igy. 

*Supermarket* – in this shop you can buy mainly food, some clothes or some tools (nářadí). In these shops you use shopping trolley or basket (nákupní vozík nebo košík). And you pay it on the cash desk. Today we also have self-service cash registers, where you don’t need a saleswoman. Sometimes it can be faster.

*Market* – you can buy under open air, especially for vegetable and fruit. Today, there are very few markets.

*Second hand shop* – this shop is better for lower social classes, because the goods like clothes or book are much cheaper and sometimes you find something in good conditions, so you don’t spend a lot of money for new clothes or books and so on

*Internet* – very comfortable, you can find absolutely anything you can buy on the internet. During the covid pandemic, people shopped a lot over the internet. I got used to it a lot. You can pay through a bank account. The disadvantage is that you have to pay for transport. 

*Highly specialized shops* – are shops with wide selections of goods

Fashion:

Fashion is a part of everyone’s life. Everyone has a different attitude (postoj) to fashion. Somebody follows every new trend and must be always fashionably and somebody has his own style. Somebody also has to have only brand-name clothes. Every group of people has it is own style. For example, people who listen to the hard music like rock, punk or metal usually wear black clothes and dark make-up. Sometimes they wear T-shirt with logo of their favourite band. Who listen hip-hop or rap wear everything big. 

There are a lot of different styles of clothing and each of them shows our personality, mood and interests. 

We can also dress according on what we do. Athletes wearing sportswear. A lawyer will wear formal clothes, such as a jacket or woman wearing a dress.

*Styles:*

- Elegant style, sport style, romantic style, skate style, tomboy style, sexy style, goth style, rocker styl, western style, traditional style, classic style, exotic style, …

*Special clothes:*

Special kinds of clothes are uniforms and costumes. Uniforms wear professionals, such as the police, the armed forces, health works, sometime workers of a certain firm. It is still a tradition in some schools in Britain (mostly private ones) to wear a school uniform.

Costumes on the other hand reflect the style of a past time. Apart from the theater they are not seen very often, only on special occasions. Scotsmen are well-known for their national costume which consists of a kilt (a short skirt with many pressed pleats), knee-length woolen socks, a cap and a sporran (a fur-covered bag worn as a purse). The kilt is made of tartan, a kind of woolen cloth woven in stripes of various colors which cross at right angles so as to form a pattern.

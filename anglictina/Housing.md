Your house: description 

Where we can live:

Flat, apartments, bungalows (jednopatrový domek), cottages (chaty), mobile house = trailer, townhouse, semi-detached house (půldomek), detached house (samostatně stojící domek), terraced house (řadový domek) block of flats (panelák), council house (obecní dům)

- The smallest traditional houses are cottages, which are situated in the countryside. They have two floors. On the second floor there are rooms and on the first one is a kitchen and a living room

Living in a city or in the country:

- In city most people live in flats, and they have to pay rent. Living in a centre of a city is more expensive than in suburbs. In a city there usually is some public transportation, but most people have their own cars. Streets are often jammed with cars and public transportation may be slow and crowded. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to get from one side of the city to the other. Traffic jam causes air pollution. The air can also be polluted by factories, which are in the city or near it. In a city there are usually many options for work. There are also many schools for children form nursery schools to universities and many option for leisure time activities lie sports clubs or hobby groups. There are a few playgrounds and parks, but it isn’t sometimes very safe, because there are dogs or the homeless. Also in the evening and at night the streets aren’t safe. In a city there are many shops and shopping centres. People can buy anything for everyone. There are many cultural events. Cinemas, theatres, exhibitions and so on. People can also go to restaurants, pubs and cafés. In a city there are many services, for example health care, from specialized doctors and dentists to big hospital. But in life in a city is sometimes very expensive and less healthy.
- Life in the country (village) is much calmer. There is fresh air and lots of greenery. Most people have their own houses with gardens and yards. They often grow their own vegetables and fruit and breed some small animals like rabbits. They don’t have to pay rent or buy eat. There are fewer work options. There are also only basic schools for children and fe hobby groups for leisure time. Problems can arise with shopping and doctors. In a village people can usually buy only basic things and in most villages, there isn’t doctor. people have to go to city to work, to school, for shopping and so on. The public transport isn’t very good and connection with a town is rare. People must have their own car to get there, or they must wait a long time. Social life in a village is quite different than that of a town. there aren’T so many cultural events. The life in a village is cheaper and healthier. 

Differences between housing in CZ and housing in UK:

- In the Czech Republic people who live in a village, live in a family house. Often there are houses with two generations of the same family. In the time of communism in the Czech Republic hundreds of apartment buildings in the cities. There live a very big percentage of the Czech population. People who live in the city often have cottages, because it is very hard to spend the whole day in the city, because there is lots of smog.
- In the U.K. young people buy a house and they pay a mortgage (hypotéka) for it. When they get promoted, they sell an old house, and they buy a new one which is larger and more expensive, and they pay the mortgage ones again. Nowadays prices of houses are very high so it's difficult to pay a mortgage for young people, so they stay at parents’ house until the time when they have enough money to make a deposit.

Typical English house:

A typical English house is a terraced house or a semi-detached house. Most houses in England are made of stone or brick. There is no plaster on them. A typical English house is quite narrow and has two floors and no cellar. On the ground floor there is a hall, the kitchen and the living room. The kitchen often has a door which opens into the garden. Upstairs, there are two bedrooms, a bathroom and a lavatory. Stairs are usually carpeted the same as the rest of the house. There is a small garden at the front of the house and a larger one at the back. For most people, a garden is a place of relaxation, so there are flowers but no vegetables. Usually there is a garage at the side.

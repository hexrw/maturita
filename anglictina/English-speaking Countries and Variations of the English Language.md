English is a language that is very widespread around the world. So, he isn’t only in England and in America, but in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and in other countries too. Many countries have this language as their mother tongue or as a second. I think it is good to be able to speak English if you want to travel a lot in life. But every country has a different English, so we have many variations of the English language. I think, nowadays, there are about 800000 words in the English language.

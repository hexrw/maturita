When we want to have our hair cut, we go to the hairdresser´s. She can wash our hair, cut it, dye and dry it or do a special

styling. We can either visit her in her salon or we can find a hairdresser who comes to our home. Men go to the barber´s

where they can have their face shaved and hair cut.

Women like going to beauty parlor and nail studios for manicure and pedicure.

When you need glasses or have your eyes checked, you can go to the optician´s. There is a variety of glasses of different shapes and colours, contact lenses or sunglasses, or goggles for cycling and skiing.

If you need a professional photo, you may go to the photographer´s. If you have your own digital photo, you can bring it on

a CD to the shop or you can send it to the shop on the internet. Then you get your photos by post.

people use email.

windows or do the laundry and do the ironing). This is not very usual in our country

An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include [entrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entr%C3%A9e), [sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_dish), [drinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink), [desserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert), or grocery items and are typically delivered in [boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box) or [bags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag).
